To do:

Ask a TA about whether or not we have to use all of the functions Ritu defined in the header file
--> do i need to use any of her code? Can i modify mine and cite my own work?

-> If allowed, work on creating two functions that will allow the computer to mark the board

1) computerPlaysToWin;
2) computerPlaysRandom;

ASK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT OUTPUT OF ASSINGNMENT HAS TO EXACTLY MATCH THAT GIVEN IN THE ASSIGNMENT PDF
OR IF I CAN SIMPLY CREATE MY OWN STYLED OUTPUT.
